You have some application ideas that involve interacting with external APIs. Your goal is to create two Python modules inside `src/apps/{app_name_slug}/`:

1. A **Streamlit frontend** (`frontend.py`) that:
   - Provides a user interface for entering queries or parameters and initiating API calls.
   - Uses **only Streamlit** for the frontend (no other UI frameworks).
   - Imports the backend module as `import src.apps.{app_name_slug}.backend`
   - Displays the results returned by the backend in a user-friendly format (e.g., JSON display).

2. A **Python backend** (`backend.py`) that:
   - Contains functions and/or classes to fetch and process data from one or more APIs.
   - Uses only Python standard library modules for making API calls.
   - Includes well-documented code explaining how the API calls are constructed and processed.
   - Returns structured Python data to be displayed by the frontend, without running a server.
   - avoid using  urllib instead use requests 
   - avoid creating servers like using flask, fastapi, socketserver etc

**Given Ideas:**
{ideas_text}

**Database of Available APIs:**
{entries_text}

**Return Instructions:**
- Return your code in plain text with the following markers:
  ```
  ---BEGIN FRONTEND CODE---
  # frontend code here
  ---END FRONTEND CODE---

  ---BEGIN BACKEND CODE---
  # backend code here
  ---END BACKEND CODE---
  ```
- Do not include JSON responses outside of code blocks.
- No server code, just API calls and processing.
