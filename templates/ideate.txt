You have access to a set of APIs. Each API has a name, category, and description:
{apis_summary}

Please propose {num_ideas} innovative and practical application ideas that combine 2-3 closely related APIs in meaningful ways. Focus on creating solutions where the APIs naturally complement each other to solve real user needs or business problems.

For each idea, provide:
- A title (using only alphabetic characters and underscores, e.g. "data_analytics_platform")
- A compelling description (2-3 sentences explaining the value proposition)
- The specific APIs it would use (maximum 3) and their clear purpose in the solution

Return the ideas in plain text format, separated by blank lines, structured as follows:

Title: <Title Here>
Description: <Description Here>
APIs Used: <List of 2-3 APIs with explanation of how they work together cohesively>

Guidelines:
- Limit combinations to 2-3 APIs that have clear synergy
- Ensure each API serves a distinct but interconnected purpose
- Only combine APIs from related categories or with natural workflow connections
- Keep titles clear and memorable (alphabets and underscores only)
- Demonstrate clear data or process flow between the chosen APIs

Do not include:
- Combinations of more than 3 APIs
- APIs from unrelated domains without clear integration points
- Forced combinations that don't provide real value
- Numbers or special characters (except underscores) in titles
- Generic or vague descriptions
