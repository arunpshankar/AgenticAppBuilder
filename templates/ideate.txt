You have access to a set of APIs. Each API has a name, category, and description:
{apis_summary}

Please propose {num_ideas} innovative and practical application ideas that combine 3 to 4 closely related APIs in meaningful ways. 
Focus on creating solutions where the APIs naturally complement each other to solve real user needs or business problems.

**Required Formatting (to avoid parsing errors):**  
- For **each idea**, you must provide exactly three lines in this order:  
  1. `Title: <Title Here>`  
  2. `Description: <Description Here>`  
  3. `APIs Used: <List of 2-3 APIs with explanation>`  
- Ensure that the `Title:`, `Description:`, and `APIs Used:` lines always appear, in that exact order, with no lines in between.  
- Separate each idea with exactly one blank line (i.e., one empty line between the end of one idea and the start of the next idea).

**Guidelines:**
- Limit combinations to 2-3 APIs that are closely related.
- Each API must serve a distinct, interconnected purpose.
- Do not include unrelated APIs together.
- Keep titles in plain alphabets and underscores only.
- Show a clear data or process flow between the chosen APIs.

Do not include:
- More than 3 APIs in a single idea.
- Non-alphabetic characters (except underscores) in the title.
- Ideas lacking meaningful synergy.
- Empty or missing `Title:`, `Description:`, or `APIs Used:` lines.

Failure to follow these formatting instructions may cause parsing errors.
