assistant: Thought: {'thought': "The GOOGLE_IMAGE_SEARCH tool has failed with an authorization error twice, suggesting an issue with the tool's API key. Since I cannot retrieve the specific images I was looking for and it's unlikely to be fixed immediately, I will resort to providing the cat facts and a generic cat image, as a simple image of a cat is still somewhat related to the query about cat facts.

assistant: Thought: {'thought': "The GOOGLE_IMAGE_SEARCH tool has consistently failed due to an authorization error. I have attempted multiple searches, including specific and generic queries. Since the image search is consistently failing, I cannot fulfill the user's request for 'appropriate images'. Therefore, I will provide the cat facts that I have already successfully retrieved and state that I was unable to retrieve images.", 'answer': 'Here are 3 cat facts:\n\n1. Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.\n2. When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.\n3. The technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to retrieve appropriate images due to an issue with the image search tool.'}
assistant: Final Answer: Here are 3 cat facts:

1. Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.
2. When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.
3. The technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”

Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve appropriate images due to an issue with the image search tool.
